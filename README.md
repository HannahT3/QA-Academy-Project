# QA-Academy-Project

## Project Overview
This project involved creating a sales report application where users can create new sales information, in addition to viewing previous sales information using certain criteria.  The purpose of this project was to draw together C# and SQL skills learnt during the QA Academy and produce a functioning application.


## Prerequisites
<ul>
  <li> Microsoft Visual Studios (or equivalent) where C# can be used.  </li>
  <li> MySQL where data can be stored. </li>
  
</ul>
  

## Process


## Conclusion
As with any new task, I expected the creation of a fully functioning application to come with its own challenges.  However, by breaking the task into smaller, more manageable tasks I was able to create a console application with the desired requirements.
*** What went well // What did not got as planned?
The inclusion of extra methods to view reports (such as the month of a specified year that made the most sales), as requested by the client would improve this project.  Further improvements could include the styling of the application to make it more aesthetically pleasing to the user.

## Notable Mentions
Special thanks to QA trainers Aswene Sivaraj and Morgan Walsh for teaching the course and their support and coding skills throughout.
