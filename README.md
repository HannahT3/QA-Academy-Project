# QA-Academy-Project

## Project Overview
This project involved creating a sales report application where users can create new sales information, in addition to viewing previous sales information using certain criteria.  The purpose of this project was to draw together C# and SQL skills learnt during the QA Academy and produce a functioning application.


## Prerequisites
<ul>
  <li> Microsoft Visual Studios (or equivalent) where C# can be used.  </li>
  <li> MySQL where data can be stored. </li>
  <li> The installation of an SQL package is needed to use MySQL on Visual Studios.  This can be done via the NuGet Package Manager by opening the Package Manager Console on Visual Studios and entering "Install-Package MySql.Data" </li>
  
</ul>
  

## Process
I first created the menus, so there were options to view on the console.  Initially I focussed on the data entry aspect and created a controller, then service, then repository and finally created and linked the database.  Following the data entry method, I repeated the process with the various report methods.

## Conclusion
As with any new task, I expected the creation of a fully functioning application to come with its own challenges.  However, by breaking the task into smaller, more manageable tasks I was able to create a console application with the desired requirements.

The inclusion of extra methods to view reports (such as the month of a specified year that made the most sales), as requested by the client would improve this project.  Further improvements could include the styling of the application to make it more aesthetically pleasing to the user and the use of generics to make the code more re-usable.

## Notable Mentions
Special thanks to QA trainers Aswene Sivaraj and Morgan Walsh for teaching the course and their support and coding skills throughout.
